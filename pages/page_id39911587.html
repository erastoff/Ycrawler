<P>GIAM (a Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics) is a free,
open-source textbook -- the current version is 3.1.  GIAM covers several 
topics in the foundations of mathematics (logic, sets, relations, 
functions and cardinality) and introduces the reader to many techniques 
of mathematical proof (direct, indirect, contradiction, contrapositive, 
mathematical induction, combinatorial proofs and magic).  There are 
amusing quotations at the start of each chapter.
